### How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member? 

Our team will work collaboratively or form small sub-teams based on the needs of the project at any given stage, rather than assigning fixed front-end or back-end roles. Other than that, to capitalize on the strength of each member:

* John could focus on visual design and styling using CSS and HTML to ensure the website is aesthetically pleasing.   
* Asa could work on implementing dynamic functionality with JavaScript and help coordinate the integration between the front and back end.   
* Maria will take the lead on server-side logic and backend development, managing database interactions and providing guidance to teammates as needed.   
* Eva will contribute to front-end development tasks and also take on the role of team organizer, helping to track progress, schedule meetings, and take notes to keep everyone aligned.

### What are the rules that will guide our team?

* **Meetings:** Our team will have two weekly 1 hour check-in meetings on Wednesdays at 6pm and Sundays at 12pm in Anderson. Other meetings will be scheduled as needed.  
* **Roles:** Maria will be responsible for scheduling meetings and creating a Google Calendar event for each one of them. The rest of the team will assume roles based on the current project at hand/the work they have completed. Everybody will be responsible for checking the group chat on a regular basis. At each meeting, a different person will be assigned to take notes.   
* **Communication:**  
  * We will use SMS to ask questions and schedule meetings, a shared Google Drive folder with all our relevant documents, including a to-do list we can comment on.  
  * Respectful communication means listening actively, responding in a timely manner, refraining from interruption, and giving constructive rather than harsh feedback.  
    * We will remain respectful by assuming good intentions and being patient with each other’s learning processes.  
  * Team members should check messages daily and respond within 24 hours when possible. If someone hasn’t responded within 24 hours, another team member will follow up. A continued lack of communication will be addressed in a group meeting.  
* **Technologies:**  
  * Collaboration Tools: Google Drive (docs, notes), Zoom (meetings), GitHub (version control), SMS (communication).  
* **Decision-Making:**  
  * Method: Consensus when possible, otherwise majority rule.  
  * If a decision is time-sensitive and consensus cannot be reached, the relevant sub-team (e.g., front-end or back-end) will make a call and inform the group.  
* **Delegation and Participation:**  
  * Work Division:  
    * Based on needs, skill sets, and interests.  
    * Clear, written individual tasks and deadlines each week.  
  * Meaningful Participation:  
    * Each person’s contribution will be valued, whether technical, design, or organizational. Regular check-ins to redistribute work if someone is overloaded. To ensure that each member is contributing, team members will be asked and held accountable for their contributions at each meeting.  
  * Expectations for Satisfactory Participation:  
    * Satisfactory participation will be defined as each team member completing the tasks that were assigned to them by the date decided by the team, and communicating any problems along the way. Team members should communicate daily.  
  * Time Commitment:   
    * 3–5 hours per week each on project-related tasks, or however long is needed in a given week. Will be adjusted as needed.   
* **Conflict Resolution:**  
  * If a member is not meeting expectations, other team members will reach out to check-in.   
  * If the issue persists, or conflict arises within the team, it will be discussed respectfully as a group. If no resolution is reached, we’ll involve the instructor. All concerns will be addressed respectfully and constructively.
