# StreamSearch Project Proposal
---

### Datasets

The datasets used in this project are 4 streaming service datasets with data on movies and TV shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hulu.   
These datasets include the following key variables:  
~~~
Show ID 
Title  
Type (Movie/TV Show) 
Director 
Cast  
Country
Date Added
Release Year
Ratin 
Duration
Genre
~~~
We plan to analyze trends and create visualizations that compare streaming platforms across dimensions like genre, country of origin, representation, and platform-specific trends. We will also include features such as searching for titles with a specific actor, or determining where a specific title can be watched.

### User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

**User Story 1: Search by Actor**  
As a fan of \[actor name\], I want to see a list of all the films and shows they appear in across streaming platforms, so I can easily find where to watch their work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* User provides an actorâ€™s name as input.
* Actor name matching is case-insensitive.
* System correctly returns a list of titles the actor appears in.
* System returns an empty dictionary when filtering by a nonexistent actor.

**User Story 2: Platform-Specific Browsing**  
As a \[streaming service\] user, I want to filter the database to show only content available on that platform, so I can browse what's available to me without sifting through other platforms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* User can enter one or more streaming platforms.
* Platform name matching is case-insensitive.
* System correctly returns titles available on the specified platforms.
* System returns an empty dictionary when the specified platform is nonexistent.
* Filter persists when combined with other search terms (e.g., actor, genre). 

**User Story 3: Explore Genre-Specific Content by Year**

As a \[genre\] fan, I want to browse all movies of that genre released after 2010 across all platforms, so I can discover new content that fits my interests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* User can enter a gengre.
* User can enter a minimum release year.
* Genre matching is case-insensitive.
* System correctly returns titles under the specified gengre.
* System correctly returns titles released after the specified year.
* System returns an empty dictionary if the genre does not exist.
* System returns an empty dictionary if the year exceeds the data range.
* System returns an empty dictionary if no titles match both filters.
* System correctly returns titles matching both the genre and year filter.
